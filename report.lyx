\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim for this third project is to create an algorithm which should be
 able to simulation the solar system.
 To make things easier, we will begin by working on a system composed by
 only two planets, the Sun and the Earth, and supposed that since the mass
 of the Sun is larger that the mass of the Earth, the motion of the sun
 can be neglect.
 Then, we will progressively add more and more planets to our system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is too important to underline the fact that we will consider all the
 motions as motions in a plane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Theory and Technicalities

\begin_layout Subsection
System Sun - Earth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Newton's law of gravitation gives us the following expression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{G}=\frac{G.M_{Earth}.M_{Sun}}{r^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula $M_{Sun}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{Earth}$
\end_inset

 are, as we can expect it, the masses of the Sun and the Earth, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the distance separating them, and 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 the gravitational constant.Thanks to this relation and to Newton's second
 law of motion, we can get:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}=\frac{F_{G,x}}{M_{Earth}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}=\frac{F_{G,y}}{M_{Earth}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{G,y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{G,x}$
\end_inset

 are the components on y and x of the gravitational force (reminder: we
 are working in a plane, which is why we don't take into account the z component
).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We want now to transform the two above equations into a set of coupled first
 order differential equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can express the components of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 by doing a projection as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{G,x}=-\frac{G.M_{Earth}.M_{Sun}}{r^{2}}.cos(\theta)=-\frac{G.M_{Earth}.M_{Sun}}{r^{3}}.x
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{G,y}=-\frac{G.M_{Earth}.M_{Sun}}{r^{2}}.sin(\theta)=-\frac{G.M_{Earth}.M_{Sun}}{r^{3}}.y
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $x=rcos(\theta)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y=rsin(\theta)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we know that, by definition,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dv}{dt}=a
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dx}{dt}=v
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Applied here, we got 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dv_{x}}{dt}=-\frac{G.M_{Sun}}{r^{3}}.x\quad\frac{dv_{y}}{dt}=-\frac{G.M_{Sun}}{r^{3}}.y
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dx}{dt}=v_{x}\quad\frac{dy}{dt}=v_{y}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By doing this, we translated our two order differential equations into one
 order differential equations.
 We want now to use interesting set of dimensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is relevant here to look a bit to the International System.
 We usually process things by using second as the unit of time variable,
 but here, we are dealing with celestial bodies.
 Thus, we will process our data with year as time unit.
 Furthermore, we will use the A.U.
 (i.e.
 Astronomical unit, the distance Sun-Earth) as the unit for the distances.
 So in terms of units, we have here -penser Ã  ajouter l'analyse dimensionnelle
 ici--
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we have here 
\begin_inset Formula $1AU=1,5.10^{11}m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1year=3,2.10^{7}s$
\end_inset

.
 The motion is supposed to be circular, thus, we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{Earth}.a_{Earth}=F_{G}=G.M_{Earth}.M_{Sun}\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad M_{Earth}.\frac{v_{Earth}}{r_{Sun-Earth}}^{2}=G.\frac{M_{Earth}.M_{Sun}}{r_{Sun-Earth}^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus : 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{Earth}^{2}=G.\frac{M_{Sun}}{r_{Sun-Earth}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is, as we said it, the distance between the Sun and the Earth.
 Thus, equal to 1AU, according to the definition of the unit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, we can rewrite this equation as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{Earth}^{2}=4\pi^{2}.[\frac{(A.U)^{2}}{year^{2}}]\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad v_{Earth}=4\pi.[\frac{AU}{year}]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will now look at how to discretize it.
 We are working on a continuous system, but want to male it into a discretized
 one.
 We will do the demonstration with the variable x, and assume that it works
 in the same way for y.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{x}=\frac{dx}{dt}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The step intervalle looks like 
\begin_inset Formula $[t_{0};t_{max}]$
\end_inset

.
 We will work on 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{Steps}$
\end_inset

.
 Let's define h as 
\begin_inset Formula $h=\frac{t_{max}-t_{0}}{n_{Steps}}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t_{i}=t_{0}+i.h\text{ for each i belonging to {\displaystyle [0,n_{Steps}],} }
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now define 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{i}=x(t_{i})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By using Taylor's expansion, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i+1}=x_{i}+h.v_{x,i}+\frac{h}{2!}^{2}.a_{x,i}(t)+\frac{h^{3}}{3!}.o(h^{5})\quad x_{i-1}=x_{i}-h.v_{x,i}(t)+\frac{h^{2}}{2!}.a_{x,i}(t)+o(h^{3})$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus [Work in Progress !!]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
// Adding more elements to our system will just be a matter of including
 their Forces in the equation's system.
 Then wouhouh !
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Structure and tools of the code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve this problem, we wrote a Runge Kutta of 4 order, in the object-oriented
 style.
 Thus, we created two main classes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CelestialBody, the class describing every objects of the solar system.
 A celestialBody contains characteristics such as a name, a mass, or vectors
 defining the position, the velocity and the force exerced by other objects,
 and a boolean, to decide wether the current object should be seen by our
 algorithm as fixed, or not.
 This feature will be very useful at first, to test our algorithm on a two
 bodies system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SolarSystem, which is basically an array of CelestialBodies.
 Thus, this class will be used to determine the force exerced by other objects,
 body after body, and will also be used to plot our system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another class, constants, is, as we can expect it, a container of all the
 astrophysic constants that were useful for this project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And to finish about program flow, all these classes were used in a main
 class, which was our controller.

Escape velocity: We now consider a planet which begins at a distance of
 1 AU from the Sun.
 We found that an initial velocity for this planet equal to 1.72464 m.s-1
 results in its escape from the Sun.

Earth - Jupiter - Sun system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Adding Jupiter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among all the planets of the solar system, we chose Jupiter since it was
 the planet which has the biggest mass.
 Indeed, its mass is only 1000 times smaller than the mass of the Sun.
 Thus, Jupiter's influence in the solar system will be the biggest, after
 the sun's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main point here is to study the stability of the results after adding
 Jupiter into our system.
 Then, we will change the mass of Jupiter, by multiplying it at first by
 a factor of 10, then by a factor of 1000.
 We expect that the change will be really small with a factor of 10, but
 that our system won't be stable with the 1000 factor.

Thanks to the plots, we can check that indeed, once that the mass of Jupiter
 becomes equal to the mass of the Sun, the stability of our algorithm becomes
 questionable:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Moving Sun
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get closer to the real system, we now consider that the Sun is moving.
 To do so, we will take the center of mass of our system not on the sun
 anymore, but on the origin of our system.
 Furthermore, we want the total momentum of the system to be 0, thus, we
 will evaluate the initial velocity of the sun as follow:

v_{Sun}=-\frac{\sum m_{Planet}*v_{Planet}}{m_{Sun}}
